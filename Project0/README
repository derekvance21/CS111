The included files are as follows:
lab0.c - source code
Makefile - with options to build the program (make), remove files created by the makefile (make clean),
    build the tarball (make dist), and test the functionality (make check)
backtrace.png - shows a segfault and associated stack-trace
breakpoint.png - shows a breakpoint and inspection of NULL pointer variable
README - information about the included files

The included smoke-test cases used in make check are as follows:
segfault_check - causes a segfault with catch enabled and checks proper exit code and stderr output
input_check - uses --input with a nonexistent file and checks proper exit code and stderr output
input_output_check - uses the program correctly and checks proper exit code and input/output equivalency
output_check - uses --output with an unwritable file and checks proper exit code and stderr output
option_check - uses the program with a nonexistent option and invalid argument and checks proper exit code and stderr output
